url_shortener_service
=====================

#### Foreword

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... I started this little repo as a proof and a bet, that I will manage to write an URL shortener service in 20-30 lines of Python code.

#### I won

There was nothing but self respect of proving that someone is wrong on the Internet. He or she was using JVM platform skills and couldn't write such small bit of code that will meet business requirements. In 2017 we have:
- Groovy and Kotlin
- Convention over configuration
- ÂµServices
- small footprint frameworks

Everything in JVM world is much more expressive than in 1995 and staying readable at this same time. But still I prefer using languages and frameworks which doesn't require an IDE for good productivity. Sticking with simple editor with plug-ins should do the work. Vim or Sublime Text are still my weapons of choice.

#### Now

Currently I have lot of time (OK, rising my son gives me *some* time on the evening) and I want to check how rusty my fingers are after doing mostly management, technical leadership and architecture in last 4+ years. There was no time for something more than quick PoC between meetings. My implementation may suck so feel free to correct me. 

#### Future

I will try to push every single day of November to reach nice Github streak. Hopefully it will give me green and nice looking profile. At the end of month I hope it will transform into nice pet project with lots of architectural concepts and integration patterns.
